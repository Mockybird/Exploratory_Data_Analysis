# Exploratory Data Analysis of Bank Customers

This repository contains code and documentation for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of bank customers. The analysis focuses on exploring various variables such as balance, deposit, age, loan status, etc., to uncover the significance of the relationships between these important variables in the dataset.

## Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the characteristics and behaviors of bank customers. By examining key variables and their relationships, we aim to understand patterns, trends, and potential factors that may influence customer behavior within the banking context.
